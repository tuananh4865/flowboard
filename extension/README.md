# Flowboard Bridge (Chrome MV3)

Local extension that proxies Flowboard agent requests to authenticated Google Flow (flow.google.com) sessions.

## Install

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this folder.

## How it works

- The service worker connects to `ws://127.0.0.1:9223` automatically when the agent is running.
- On first sign-in at `flow.google.com` the `Authorization: Bearer ya29.*` token is captured automatically from outgoing request headers.
- Responses to agent `api_request` commands are sent via HTTP POST to `http://127.0.0.1:8101/api/ext/callback` with an `X-Callback-Secret` header (secret supplied by the agent on connect). WS fallback is used if HTTP fails.
- A keepalive `ping` is sent every ~24 s; disconnections trigger an automatic reconnect in ~5 s.
- When an `api_request` includes `captchaAction`, the extension solves a reCAPTCHA Enterprise challenge via the injected MAIN-world script (`injected.js`) running on the Flow tab, then patches the token into the request body before forwarding.
- `trpc_request` commands are proxied directly to `https://labs.google/` with the captured Bearer token and browser credentials.

## Content script + injected script

`content.js` runs at `document_start` on `flow.google.com*` pages. It injects `injected.js` into the MAIN world so it can reach `window.grecaptcha.enterprise`. The two scripts communicate via `CustomEvent` (`GET_CAPTCHA` / `CAPTCHA_RESULT`).

## Popup
